<p>Today I finally got to work with Alejandra on my website.  We got blogging set up, and now I  actually know how to do things on it.  There’s still a lot that has to be done to polish it, especially in terms of CSS and making it not look terrible, but I’m really happy with it right now.</p>

<p>I also sat in on a very, very long new business meeting with John and Brett.  I get the sense that they’re not usually two hours, and I’ll admit, I zoned out a little bit from time to time.  I tried to take as  many notes as I could, though, and ended up with some useful things.  What I  thought was interesting was just how general the meeting was— I mean, it covered everything.  Partially, that was the client asking questions, but I was just surprised that it went over so much.  Then again, it was a two-hour meeting.  I was also surprised by the fact that the next meeting is about two months from now, because I basically assumed that they would be closer together.  Anyway, despite the length, or maybe because of it, it was very informative and I learned a lot about how Eight Bit handles new clients.</p>
