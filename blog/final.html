<p>Today was my last day as an intern at Eight Bit Studios.  I got to present what I learned, which was both terrifying and satisfying.  Overall, the internship was an excellent learning experience for me and I’m glad I was able to take it.</p>

<p>Ironically, or maybe not, the hardest part of the internship was trying to compile it all into a presentation, and now to compile it into one final writeup.  I learned such a ridiculous about of stuff, it’s impossible to say it all.  Partially because I can’t remember it all.  Since I already compiled my experience into a powerpoint, I thought, instead of looking back more, I’d direct this towards future Eight Bit interns.</p>

<p>Future interns of Eight Bit, I’m going to give you a few facts, and tell you about these facts.  You can take them or leave them, but at least read them well.</p>

<p>First off, perfection isn’t real.  You’ve probably heard something like this before, but it’s important to keep in mind and to apply to your own work.  Your work will absolutely never be perfect.  It may look perfect to one viewer, but not to another, and it will never look perfect to you.  Whether it’s perfect is irrelevant.  Instead of asking yourself if your thing is perfect, ask if it’s complete.  Is there still something Not Right?  Something leaving you dissatisfied?  Something you think needs fixing?  Have you asked for second opinions yet?  Keep going.</p>

<p>Second, plan ahead.  I nearly messed up my website big time because I didn’t know what I  wanted to do with it.  Planning can be boring and tedious and terrible, but it’s worth it in the long run.  You may not even do anything with your plans, but that doesn’t mean it was all for naught.  I spent a long time painstakingly planning out and wireframing every corner of my website and most of it was either axed or completely changed.  Just about none of it survived to the final iteration.  However, it put me on the right track, and got me organized.</p>

<p>And finally, don’t resist human interaction.  Other people will always be there, and if you’re a shy introvert like me or you just don’t have much patience, you’re going to want to resist.  You’re going to have to present to people someday, and you’re always going to have to deal with them, so you might as well get used to it— even better, you can get really good at it.  You can start small, with participating in dev meetings and showing your work to your mentor.</p>

<p>A few speaking tips: If you don’t know why you did something, don’t say you didn’t know.  Say you changed it, but don’t try to make an excuse you don’t have.  Also, speak slow.  Talking faster is where Um and Uh start coming in, and you might even start stuttering.  Avoid the embarrassment and slow down.  Finally, always know what you want to say.  The first time I was called on in a dev meeting, I wasn’t expecting it, so I floundered for the worst 10-15 seconds of my life.  It was terrible.  I’m not sure what I said, but I know I don’t want to relive it.  Try not to be caught off guard.</p>

<p>Stay hydrated at all costs and don’t forget to eat!  You’ll do fine.</p>
