<p>I have returned to Eightbit after a week in Canada, and now I’m facing the presentation I have to make on Friday.</p>

<p>Alejandra provided me with two really good sources, one being an entire website, that I read thoroughly.  I’m a bit of a wreck at public speaking, so they’re super helpful.  My problem is that I usually tend to talk fast, but I also trip over my words constantly, even when I’m not nervous, so me trying to present is generally just an awkward experience for everything.  I  also need to pick a subject, but I think I’m starting to latch onto a good idea.</p>

<p>What I’ve taken away from the reading is that I should prioritize speaking slower and practicing what I want to say.  I’ve gotten into the habit of winging presentations based on the powerpoints I make, which, while feasible, doesn’t look good.  I got through it on principle of my only solo presentations being in my German class, where there were far worse presentations that made mine look like I’d poured my soul into them. Obviously, that’s not going to fly here, or at all in the future.  I’m considering having notes, but I’ve also had horrible moments in mock trials where I suddenly can’t read my handwriting when I’m supposed to be performing a cross-examination, so maybe it’s not the best idea.</p>

<p>On a completely different note, the website is looking very finished, except for one fatal error: the sidebar link only works on the index and portfolio pages.  I have no idea how to fix this.  I do think I know why, though— it redirects to .blog/art.html#recent, which doesn’t exist, instead of /art.html#recent.  Maybe tomorrow I’ll look for ways to link to a part of a page without using #.</p>
