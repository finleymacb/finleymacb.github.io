<p>Well, thanks to the middleman server being weird, I had a while where I  was totally in the dark HTML-wise for a while.  Thanks to James, the issue’s fixed and hopefully I’ll remember how to reboot the server in the future.</p>

<p>Aside from that, most of the changes I made were small changes.  I worked more on the color scheme, mainly with the background and link colors.  I’m still a little iffy on the link colors, but I think I want to get second opinions first.  Since I am forever indecisive with my footer, I replaced the icons with plain text.  Again.  Also, I finally decided to remove the archive page, forever.  My nav looks a little weird with only two tabs now, but I might just increase the margin and center them a little more, I don’t know yet.</p>

<p>I also finally brought some recent art files from my desktop and got the sidebar up to date.  Right now, the sidebar is definitely looking how I want it to look, and working how I want it to work (the image itself is a link to its place in the art page).  Currently, instead of a description, I just have the date it was added, because I think it’s redundant if I’m going to have the image link to the description, and I don’t want to have too much clutter.  Okay, I just discovered that the link only works on the index page, so that’s something else I have to fix.</p>
