<p>I have finally, <em>finally</em> found a decent sidebar method. No wordpress, no weird spacing, no "just paste this here!"— I finally made an actual sidebar.  It’s even complete, and it looks nice.  I also changed the entire color scheme of my blog, so there’s no more giant red backgrounds.  Right now, I’m pretty happy with how it looks.  Tomorrow, I plan on making the sidebar actually functional— ie make it actually link to the most recent piece of art updated, which means I’ll have to actually grab the pieces from my desktop at home.  I’ll set an alarm so I actually remember to do that.</p>

<p>I also went to a dev meeting today, and I had to talk about my stuff, which I was really not expecting, but I managed.  While shaking and screaming internally a little bit.  Anyway, I wasn’t entirely sure what to talk about, so from what I  can remember I  just muttered about needing to change my CSS and those awful #FF0000 backgrounds.  I think I have gotten better about talking about my work; then again, I didn’t have to justify any of my decisions, I just had to talk about what I needed to do.</p>

<p>Immediately after the dev meeting was the dev trust fall, which I thought was pretty fun— and not just because of the food.  I liked just how someone could share what they’re working on and get feedback or input or recommendations, even if I couldn’t follow the conversations.  Now that I  think about it, I would have liked to participate, but my blog seems so uninteresting compared to what everyone else was working on.</p>
