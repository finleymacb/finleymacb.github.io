    Hello
  </h3>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Finley.  I'm from Chicago and I'm currently an intern at Eight Bit Studios.  I'm proficient in Adobe Photoshop and I can use Illustrator and InDesign.  I can do illustration, graphic design, and some 3D modeling.  I'm also learning to code HTML and CSS and this website is, essentially, my guinea pig.

      I've had an interest in graphic design since eighth grade, but it never overshadowed my passion for illustration.  That's why I try to integrate it into my design work.  Of course, I still draw on the side, as well.  You can see all that under <b>"Portfolio"</b>.
