description: I'm really tired, but hey, my nav looks good.

###August 26
I spent most of the day trying to figure out what subject to do for my presentation, but my brain is too tired to hold on to one thing for more than a minute.

Aside from this internal struggle, I went to my last dev meeting and tried to talk about my work.  I mentioned that I hadn’t been able to find a way to make my nav responsive to hovering.  Afterwards, I tried a thing I’d seen on codepen.  It didn’t work, probably because I only did CSS.  Eventually, as I continued to get more frustrated, I  gave up and tried the nav a:hover thing I swear I’d tried originally.  And it worked.  Maybe that wasn’t what I tried the first time.  Maybe I accidentally omitted something.  I don’t care, at this point— my nav is finally done!

Also, I may have decided on a focus for my presentation.  Right now, I’m thinking I’ll dissect my internship week by week.  I don’t really have time to think up something else.  I’ll make it work.
