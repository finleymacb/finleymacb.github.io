description: Well, I fixed the sidebar!

###August 25
Today was a short day.  A really short day.  I mostly just fixed things— the sidebar link works on the blog pages now.  I also added the most recent piece of art, technically, that I had done.  There was a bit of weirdness with the link not working, but I fixed that.  i just have to remember to keep the #recent tag in div id, not div class, which would just send the link to the portfolio.

Still haven’t decided the topic for Friday, but I’m getting there.  Apparently, though, this computer doesn’t have keynote, which throws a wrench in things.
