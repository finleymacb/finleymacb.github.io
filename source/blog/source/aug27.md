###August 27
Aside from the 2.5-hour hole left by Quickstart, today was productive!  At least, opposed to yesterday.  I finally started working on my powerpoint, and while it’s a bit jumbled, it’s better than having nothing at all. Like I did yesterday.  I kind of wish I had an actual topic aside from INTERNSHIP, but I also think that that’s what everyone’s expecting and it’d be a little weird to not do it on my internship, even if it is technically lunch & learn.

I’m making the slides match my website in color scheme and font, but I think I’ll make custom slide templates when I get home.  It’ll make up for doing it in Google Slides instead of keynote.  this will be the prettiest presentation I’ve ever made.  I must stay loyal to the design part of the internship.

The only thing that’s really worrying me at this point is that my github page is still giving me a 404 when I try to go to my URL, and I’m too nervous to mess with terminal to push my stuff right now.  I’ll figure it out (meaning: ask someone) tomorrow.
